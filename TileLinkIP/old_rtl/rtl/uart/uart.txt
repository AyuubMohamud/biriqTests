This is a very simple UART RX/TX slave, supporting configurable baud rates and interrupts.

Address map:
0x00:   Configuration and Status Register (R/W)
    Bit 0 - Enable interrupt when TX Fifo is not full
    Bit 1 - Enable interrupt when RX Fifo is not empty
    Bit 2 - Enable Transmission/Recival
    Bit 14:3 - Baud Rate divisor
    Bit 15 - RX Fifo full
    Bit 16 - RX Fifo empty
    Bit 17 - TX Fifo full
    Bit 18 - TX Fifo empty

The baud rate divisor sets the UART speed according to the following equation:

uart_clock_frequency/baud_rate_divisor = baud_rate

For example for running at 100MHZ and a 115200 baud rate:
Using the equation :
100000000/115200 = 868

Setting the baud rate divisor at 868 will then set the UART to operate at 115200 bits per second.

0x04:   Transmission FIFO (W only)
    Bit 7:0 - Value to write

0x08:   Recival FIFO (R only)
    Bit 7:0 - Value received
